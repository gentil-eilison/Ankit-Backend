# Ankit API

Ankit API is the back-end system for the Ankit application, a website with the goal of helping students acquire foreign-language
vocabulary in an efficient way using evidence-based techniques and generative AI powers.

This project was built using Cookiecutter Django as boilerplate.

# The Idea

Studying languages is a pretty interesting hobby. It allows one to communicate with people around the world, get to know different cultures and even
get better job opportunities. However, many people struggle to remember or to learn new vocabulary. Learning new words when studying a new language is extremely
important, for it enables speakers of the language to communicate more effectively and understand when being spoke to. Therefore, the idea of a web application
which would have an optimized workflow for acquiring vocabulary without the need for the students themselves to know how to apply effective learning techniques
is alluring, reducing the time needed to invest in language learning.

# Ankit

The application consists of a website that would allow users to create study sessions and generate flashcards based on a specific topic they want to learn. The use-case
diagram of Ankit can be seen below:

![Ankit - Casos de Uso](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e3b2deb-94ea-404b-b8b2-154e9c9f5167)

After creating their accounts (whether by using social login with Google or through traditional credentials), users can create study sessions, which will be, ideally, about
a specific topic on a specific langauge. On a specific study session page, they will be present a form where they can select multiple options for the format of their flashcards:
* **Advanced**: The back of the flashcard will contain the definition of a word on the language being studied
* **Intermediate**: The back of the flashcard will have the definition of a word on Brazilian Portuguese
* **Basic**: The back of the flashcard will have the Brazilian Portuguese version of the phrase on the front of the card

 The front of the flashcard will always contain a phrase on the target language generated by OpenAI's ChatGPT based on the topic the user sent on form. For example: if they sent the text "Banheiro",
 ChatGPT will create a list of flashcards (by default, 10 flashcards) about that topic.

 After finishing the study session, it will be locked, meaning the user won't be able to add or remove flashcards from the session. After this, they can download the flashcards as a CSV file to be
 imported directly into [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), a spaced-repetition-system.

Other features of the system include:
1. User streak
2. User statistics, like amount of flashcards by language

 The C4 model on a Context level can be seen on the image below.

The Gmail service is used to send verification e-mails to users after they're done filling the sign up form.

The C4 model on a Container level is shown below.

The distributed task queue is used to execute jobs which update the users streak.

## Settings

Moved to [settings](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Initial Setup

- Run the following commands after downloading the application:

```
$ python manage.py migrate`
$ python manage.py load_nationalities`
$ python manage.py load_languages`
$ python manage.py load_superuser`
```

Those commands, respectively, run database migrations; load nationality and language database data and creates a default superuser for administration tasks. Both the e-mail and password can be found on the `load_superuser.py` file. You'll need to create a `.env` fil as well based on the `.env-EXAMPLE` file.

- To create a new superuser, use the following comand:

      $ python manage.py createsuperuser

### Celery

This application uses Celery as a distributed task queue, containing periodic pre-configured periodic tasks and also the ones set up by the administrator for the database backup. Because of that, you'll need to run both celery worker and  celery_beat.

### Runing the Project
To run the project locally, without Docker, run these commands:

```
$ python manage.py runserver
$ celery -A config.celery_app worker --loglevel=INFO
$ celery -A config.celery_app beat --loglevel=INFO
```

Done!

To run the application with Docker, create, in the project's root folder, a folder named `.envs` and, and inside of it, another one named `.local`. In the `.local` folder, you'll need two files: (1)`.django`, containing Django's container environment variables; (2) `.postgres`, where PostgreSQL environment variables will be kept. After following those steps, run:

```
docker compose -f local.yml build
docker compose -f local.yml up
```

Done!
